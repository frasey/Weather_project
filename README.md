# Weather or Not
This was a group project. We created an app where you can input a city or town anywhere in the world and it will give you an hourly breakdown of the weather. We used this data to determine what you would need to wear or take with you when you leave the house for the day. We also used HighChart graphs to show data and Leaflet maps to see the location the user selected.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
